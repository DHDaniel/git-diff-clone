
# Python git diff clone

This project is an implementation of the `git diff` tool in Python using the Myers Difference algorithm.

## Usage

Once you clone the repository on your machine, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ python diff.py fileA fileB
```

This will show the diff script to go from file A to file B. You can test out the command with the `test1.txt` and `test2.txt` files included in the repository.

To have the command available at all times, make sure the script `diff.py` is executable and then include it in your `$PATH`.
